###Introduction:
* Problem: how to simulate these real world scenarios(the above chosen systems) 
and observe how they interact with each other over a long period of time based 
on the specific features that affect each entity. 

* Design goals: Model a general cell that any real world scenario can extend from. 
This cell abstraction contains enough generic features(class fields) and cell 
actions(class methods) possible. Model a generic grid that can create any number of 
grids required for the specific real world scenario being modeled.

* Primary architecture: The architecture of our project would consist of a Cell.java 
class that serves as a super class for different simulations of CAs we want to make. 
The Grid.java class would be closed for internal modification and to update the Cells. 
 
 
###Overview:


###User Interface:

For our Cell Society, the users would be able to determine the size (row & column) of 
the grid. There will be a drop down that users can determine what simulation they want 
to run, which will choose a class of simulation that will be run. We would have three 
buttons: PLAY, RESET, and PAUSE, that will let the users control the current Cell simulation.
